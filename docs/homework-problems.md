# Summer Homework Problems

In preparation for this week I set up the codebase for you to solve problems in. Over the summer I'm going to be giving you problems to solve (about once a week) and I've provided the first one below. Before you complete the first one, **I'd like you to set up the codebase for this from scratch yourself**, which might mean you need to research some things I've not taught you. Now that you have a better understanding of how to basically program, I'm going to set some expectations regarding the work you do with me that will be a little stricter than I've been this week.

## Setup

1. Set up a new Github repository in your account
2. In this repository, set up a new Java project using **any build tool or IDE of your choice** (Maven, Gradle, Intellij, Eclipse, Ant)
3. In this project, make sure there is somewhere for both the code and tests
4. Make sure there is at least one class with a 'main' function which compiles without errors or warnings

## Workflow

* Once you've finished the setup, please don't commit to the `master` branch directly. Problems should be solved **on a branch**. When you think you are done, raise a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
* Create an entirely new package for each new problem
* Once you submitted a PR, I'll review your code based on the guidelines provided [here](what-im-looking-for.md)
* I'll provide feedback, and either ask you to make changes, or if I'm happy, I'll merge it into master
