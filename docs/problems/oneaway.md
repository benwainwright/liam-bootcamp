# One Away

## Problem Statement

There are three types of edits that can be performed ona strings: insert a character. Remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

## Example

* `pale, ple` -> `true`
* `pales,  pale` -> `false`
* `pale, bale` -> `true`
* `pale, bake` -> `false`
